# Recipes
Baking App (Udacity project, Stage 3) is a project requested by Udacity during the Android nanodegree.

## What the app do:
Allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

###### Important note:
The App won't work as it doesn't contain the RECIPIES API URL.

## What have i learnt:
1. Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
2. Handle error cases in Android.
3. Add a widget to your app experience.
4. Leverage a third-party library in your app.
5. Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
6. Use ViewPager to allow user to swip across steps.
